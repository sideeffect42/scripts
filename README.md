 * merely a (seemingly) random collection of scripts I had once written and
 * found they could be useful for other people, too. The guides are simply a
 * record of the steps I took to achieve my personal goals on my device(s).
 * Just because they worked this way for me does not imply that they work
 * equally well (or at all) for your use case!

 * As a result, I CAN NOT BE HELD LIABLE for any damage that might occur to your
 * personal or other people's data, software, and/or hardware.
 *
 * It is very(!) advisable to study the source code of all the scripts found in
 * this repository before executing them.
 * Please do your own research prior to executing any commands that you do not
 * fully understand.
